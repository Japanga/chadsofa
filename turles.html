<p>"Jiren and Makima were in bed together, their naked bodies intertwined as they kissed each other passionately on the lips. The two of them had been married for over ten years now, and despite their age difference, they both loved one another very much.
"I love you too, honey," said Makima. "You're my life."
"And I'm yours," replied Jiren with a smile. He turned to look at her, his eyes still closed as he placed his hand on her cheek. "When we made this decision to help others in need, I never thought it would be so fulfilling. It's given me such joy to see how happy people have been since we started doing our work."
"Well, if it weren't for your hard work none of that would've ever happened," said Makima. "This is all thanks to you."
"That's true," agreed Jiren. "But I am just glad I was able to make things better for everyone else around me... especially you."
His wife smiled and nodded. "As long as you're by my side, I'll always be okay, no matter what happens. You mean more to me than anything in the world."
Jiren's face softened as he looked back up at her. His heart filled with pure happiness. He wrapped his arms around her body once again, holding her close, before placing a kiss on her forehead."</p>
  
    <p>""I am not sure if this is just a common cold or something more serious, but I will make you some medicine." Makima said while holding the bowl that was filled with water and ginger.
Jiren's face looked pale as usual due to his illness, but now it seemed even paler than before. He had been sleeping for a few days already, so Makima wasn't sure how long he would be out of action.
"Oh dear, you are not going anywhere right?" Makima asked. "You are in no condition to walk."
As expected from a wife who took good care of her husband, she didn't sound worried at all. She sounded like a mother looking after her sick child rather than a wife. It made me feel uncomfortable.
But Makima only smiled at his discomfort, which made him even more uncomfortable.
"There is nothing for me to do here anyway," Makima said while sitting next to Jiren's bed. "And I think you need rest."
She then started making the medicine using simple ingredients such as ginger roots, dried leaves, and white sandalwood.
"Is this... tea?" Jiren asked.
"Yes," Makima answered. "It is very rare for an adult to have a common cold, so I thought that perhaps it may be something more serious."
"So you gave me medicine?" Jiren asked. "I'm sorry. I knew I should've told you sooner."
"There is nothing wrong with you telling your wife about what you're feeling," Makima replied. "It makes us closer."
"Thank you, Makima," Jiren said, sounding much better than before. "I owe you one."
Then he closed his eyes again and fell asleep.
Makima watched him sleep for a bit before speaking up.
"You have been taking care of me ever since we were married," Makima said. "When I got pregnant, you took care of me until I gave birth. And when I was recovering after giving birth, you did everything for me."
"I don't mind doing those things," Makima said. "You are my husband."
"What I mean is..." Jiren continued. "Are you happy? Like really happy?"
"Of course," Makima answered immediately. "Why wouldn't I be?"
Jiren smiled."</p>
  
    <p>"Jiren and Makima wedding was held in the church of the city, on a beautiful spring day. There were few guests, but they all gathered to celebrate with them. Jiren's mother had prepared for this event since long ago and she looked very happy that it finally came true. The priest who conducted the ceremony was also an old friend of Jiren's father; so he brought him up as his son, and treated him like a grandson.
The church was decorated beautifully with flowers from the gardens of the city. When Jiren entered, everyone present stood up. He walked slowly towards the altar where his wife-to-be waited for him. She looked at her fiancé with a smile as big as the sun. They exchanged rings and kissed each other before the marriage ceremony began. Everyone applauded when they saw their love. It was truly the most amazing moment in Jiren's life.
"We will make you proud." Jiren said to his parents after the ceremony. "You have done everything for me, and I hope we can repay your kindness one day."
His parents smiled happily when they heard those words. His mother hugged him tightly, while his father beamed proudly at him from behind.
After the ceremony, there was a huge feast in the dining hall. Jiren felt like he could eat anything right now. He was still hungry even after he finished his food. He decided to take some fruits instead. Then he sat down beside his new bride.
"I am glad I got married here," he told her.
"Me too." She replied sweetly. "It is my dream to get married here."
He looked at her with a grin. "Well, now you are living your dreams."
She giggled. "You always say that."
"That's because it's the truth."</p>
