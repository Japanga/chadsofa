   Rukiafag: I see. I've heard about all the Rabbitrun/Sakurako stuff I just had no idea she was basically one of the main contributors on the site.  Sometimes it seems like they actually want to get me on their streams cause they've had moments where they would ask me to go on right after I would post. But no don't worry at all, we are not that close and I only took Gigi off for a brief moment because I was in a pissy mood.  No individual user holds any major influence over what I decide to put on or how I approach the overall style/magic of the site cause it is always mine at the end of the night.

  Tienrus: The Sakurakofag is another person. 
>I just had no idea she was basically one of the main contributors on the site.   
This assumes that Dergrosse is Pintar, something we do not know for certain.
>Sometimes it seems like they actually want to get me on their streams cause they've had moments where they would ask me to go on right after I would post. 
They ask everyone to join the streams to keep them alive because, after the reveal, some people backed out since Pintar (and therefore Rabbitrun) is an actual real pedophile.

Rukiafag: My personal theory was that DerGrosse might have been that Brazilian that was getting real annoying... Crazy, I know: but this whole focus on getting TablosAF on there seemed like it was part of some thing about latino heritage/pride. After actually seeing Rabbitrun change their username to DerGrosseScholar in the streams though this theory doesn't really work as well now...

!!
Did you, really? That would mean that it was Pintar all along. 
Remember, she’s after power. And she’s not an oldfag, so the info she gave you probably came from lurking the archives or digging through the old wiki.
>but this whole focus on getting TablosAF on there seemed like it was part of some thing about latino heritage/pride.  
Did she push for that article, or do you mean the buufag?

Rukiafag: Yep. I attended last night but bailed after they were watching some weird Kid Goku prequel episodes. Now this is called DECEPTION.  I may leave DerGrosseScholar in that section, but it does not grant Pinny any real power over my site. The same way I lied about taking off Gigi because some scholars hate them and won't use my site if they think Gigi shit is on it.  </p>

    <p>Rukiafag: I don't know if Pinny herself pushed to give Tablos an article, I just saw some GT Goku fag shitposting what looked like an article prototype for Tablos and decided to give him an article on that day and the other Anons shitposted some Tablos stuff including Geekdom's interaction with him</p>
  
   <p>Tienrus: Did you talk to her off-site about any of this? This post seems too random, unless she knew she'd been exposed.</p>
  
    <p>Rukiafag: Nah, I have never spoken off-site with Pintar. Or really any other anons for that matter (.....except that damn /csm/ demon Diaper)</p>
  
  <p>Tienrus: I mean, you had to have at some point, right? Otherwise, how would DerGrosseScholar have sent you the info?</p>
  
    <p>Rukiafag: It was all in the threads. I realized that month as we were making it that basically no one used the email cause we just communicate all the new content additions through pure shitposting. Like when I accidentally doxxed Risu's twitter, she gets pissed, I take it off, she doxxes Paragon and starts drawing lots of anti-Paragon OC for the article.  It seemed like we mainly just use the threads to decide and make content for the site which is why I took the email off the front page after the first big major update</p>
  
  <p>Tienrus: I see. Thank you for the clarification.</p>
  
  
  
  
    <p>******MOST RECENT EMAILS*******</p>

    <p>Tienrus: I warned you about the creation of another wiki. Didn't I?</p>
  
  <p>Rukiafag: Yes indeed..... This isn't too serious, GitHub rules probably strictly prevent openly stealing and re-hosting other people's code</p>
  
  <p>Rukiafag: I think with enough persistent reporting they will eventually take down his fake repository/site and he is probably even going to get banned</p>
  
    <p>Tienrus: Just so you know: RTHly, Pintar and Sakurakofag still post and are the ones behind your bullying.
RTHly is obvious.
I'm going to give you a way to detect Pintar's posts: The fatso uses ’ instead of '. So have fun reading the thread and seeing her posts.
Sakurakofag is the hardest to point but no reason to believe he doesn't post anymore.

I'm telling you this because I believe you should remove them from the wiki, or at the very least, show their true colors. They aren't beloved, they are cancer</p>
