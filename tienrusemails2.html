Tienrus: Is this person you, or someone else? If it isn't you, I would appreciate it if you could tell me who you think it might be.
    </p>
  
    <p> 
Rukiafag: Looks like Tienrus early in the wiki history, he was a lil evil and tried hard to shut it down in the beginning. We've went down and back up a good few times already though
    </p>
  
     <p> 
Rukiafag: Hmmm, odd. I don't know much about Dergrosse except that he is primarily the Dragon Ball AF poster, and made a claim for giving me most of the article info like the Geekdom/Risu tweets.
    </p>
  
       <p> 
Tienrus: So he didn’t make any demands and just gave you the information?
Also, I know this might put me in a bit of a tough spot, but I’m curious about why the Gigi mention was removed.
    </p>
  
      <p> 
Rukiafag: Yeah
The Gigi thing was mostly just a joke, but when I woke up this morning I saw some post where he was avatarfagging as her talking about "/trash/rats trying to turn this place into a Discord". Maybe I just took it too personal, but I didn't really like that remark. Me and B also got into a bit of a dispute earlier when he thought i was spamming some garbage to the thread. I will likely quietly re-instate her with no announcement like last time as i've always dealt with a bit of fighting and ruckus about putting the moewives on there.
    </p>
  
      <p> 
Tienrus: There's a strong possibility that the person behind the screencap I sent you is "Pintar", since she's the only one consistently trying to turn the threads into a safe space for content she personally approves of.  I suspected that Dergrosse might be her as well, mainly because he became a mod on the stream shortly after Rabbitrun "left" (which, as you might know, didn't really happen), and because he used the term "GREEKdom", a phrase Rabbitrun (Pintar) also used frequently over there.
If it turns out that Dergrosse suggested removing the Gigi mentions, that would strongly confirm my suspicions. But if he had no involvement, it all might be just be a coincidence.
Either way, I'd advise staying alert because Pintar might try to influence your wiki directly or even attempt to create a competing one, under the argument that yours includes things she doesn't like. Reminder that this user has all the time in the world given that she basically lives in the threads 24/7.

      <p> 
Tienrus: Finally, I want to express my support for your project. If you ever decide to investigate someone, I'd be happy to help. I completely understand if you'd rather avoid getting involved in drama, but I should mention that, based on the behavior that I've seen from the streams, a kind of pseudo-Discord might be forming behind the scenes to influence or control the threads.

Rukiafag: Oh my god.... Thanks for telling me that. I know who Pintar is, of course. Kinda obnoxious and takes up a lot of space in the threads these days.... but I seem to know she's some sort of streamer?  I've went on them a few times. I never really knew if she likes me or not cause I haven't really directly spoken to her, she just kind of showed up out of absolutely nowhere around the sort of 2024 era when I was doing a lot of that anti-Piccolo/Rei/Cain posting (and she sort of took over the anti-Piccolo stuff entirely, which I do have to be somewhat thankful for because now it's like the meme completely swapped ownership so I can do all my regular stuff without getting accused of doing it again)
    </p>
  
    <p> 
Rukiafag: And thanks a lot for your support, updates have been less frequent lately so I could move past a lot of the "work in progress" psycho shitposting frenzy (and also because next month is my birthday and i'm trying to stall this July out and breeze through it quick so I can get some mangas ordered as a present)
I've already got the next set of pages I want to restore picked out though and I will be making them live in a few days so we can go ahead and go all the way to 40 pages since we already have the rather impressive amount of around 32
I heard the Tienbro did a .zip archive of all the Yabba copypastas that would be GOLD for a Krillin article. I could probably find it in the archive but would be easier if you wanna go look for it too
    </p>
  
    <p> 
Tienrus: 
Honestly, I thought you knew more:  
Pintar, also known as Rabbitrun, is the owner of the Cytube stream channel theHALLS. No, it’s not the Belgian.
She started using the name Rabbitrun because she knew people wouldn't join the stream if they knew she was the one running it. 
She pretended to leave the threads and the stream to avoid taking heat from people as they were making fun of her. Upon "leaving" she modded the following: Piccolofag (might be the "detective"), Bejitafag (though this guy might not be a real Bejitabro / also french), Sakurakofag, and, as mentioned before, Dergrosse (random who appeared out of nowhere).
As for whether she likes you or not, I can’t say for sure. But I do know she even falseflags as the Panfag to attack him (despite claiming multiple times that she had no issue with him). So I'd be cautious. Pretending to like you could be a strategy to influence the wiki by adding or removing content to suit her preferences.
    </p>
  
    <p> 
  Tienrus: The Sakurakofag is another person. 
>I just had no idea she was basically one of the main contributors on the site.   
This assumes that Dergrosse is Pintar, something we do not know for certain.
>Sometimes it seems like they actually want to get me on their streams cause they've had moments where they would ask me to go on right after I would post. 
They ask everyone to join the streams to keep them alive because, after the reveal, some people backed out since Pintar (and therefore Rabbitrun) is an actual real pedophile.
    </p>
  
      <p> 
Rukiafag: My personal theory was that DerGrosse might have been that Brazilian that was getting real annoying... Crazy, I know: but this whole focus on getting TablosAF on there seemed like it was part of some thing about latino heritage/pride. After actually seeing Rabbitrun change their username to DerGrosseScholar in the streams though this theory doesn't really work as well now...
    </p>

Tienrus: >After actually seeing Rabbitrun change their username to DerGrosseScholar in the streams though this theory doesn't really work as well now...  
!!
Did you, really? That would mean that it was Pintar all along. 
Remember, she’s after power. And she’s not an oldfag, so the info she gave you probably came from lurking the archives or digging through the old wiki.
>but this whole focus on getting TablosAF on there seemed like it was part of some thing about latino heritage/pride.  
Did she push for that article, or do you mean the buufag?

    </p>
  
    <p> 
Rukiafag: Yep. I attended last night but bailed after they were watching some weird Kid Goku prequel episodes. Now this is called DECEPTION.  I may leave DerGrosseScholar in that section, but it does not grant Pinny any real power over my site. The same way I lied about taking off Gigi because some scholars hate them and won't use my site if they think Gigi shit is on it.  </p>

    <p>Rukiafag: I don't know if Pinny herself pushed to give Tablos an article, I just saw some GT Goku fag shitposting what looked like an article prototype for Tablos and decided to give him an article on that day and the other Anons shitposted some Tablos stuff including Geekdom's interaction with him</p>
  
   <p>Tienrus: Did you talk to her off-site about any of this? This post seems too random, unless she knew she'd been exposed.</p>
  
    <p>Rukiafag: Nah, I have never spoken off-site with Pintar. Or really any other anons for that matter (.....except that damn /csm/ demon Diaper)</p>
  
  <p>Tienrus: I mean, you had to have at some point, right? Otherwise, how would DerGrosseScholar have sent you the info?</p>
  
    <p>Rukiafag: It was all in the threads. I realized that month as we were making it that basically no one used the email cause we just communicate all the new content additions through pure shitposting. Like when I accidentally doxxed Risu's twitter, she gets pissed, I take it off, she doxxes Paragon and starts drawing lots of anti-Paragon OC for the article.  It seemed like we mainly just use the threads to decide and make content for the site which is why I took the email off the front page after the first big major update</p>
  
  <p>Tienrus: I see. Thank you for the clarification.</p>
  
  
  
  
    <p>******MOST RECENT EMAILS*******</p>

    <p>Tienrus: I warned you about the creation of another wiki. Didn't I?</p>
  
  <p>Rukiafag: Yes indeed..... This isn't too serious, GitHub rules probably strictly prevent openly stealing and re-hosting other people's code</p>
  
  <p>Rukiafag: I think with enough persistent reporting they will eventually take down his fake repository/site and he is probably even going to get banned</p>
  
    <p>Tienrus: Just so you know: RTHly, Pintar and Sakurakofag still post and are the ones behind your bullying.
RTHly is obvious.
I'm going to give you a way to detect Pintar's posts: The fatso uses ’ instead of '. So have fun reading the thread and seeing her posts.
Sakurakofag is the hardest to point but no reason to believe he doesn't post anymore.

I'm telling you this because I believe you should remove them from the wiki, or at the very least, show their true colors. They aren't beloved, they are cancer</p>
