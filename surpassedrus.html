                           <p><img src="https://yourimageshare.com/ib/q9JtdOZ0jQ.jpg" alt="Smiley face" style="float:right;width:300px;height:360px;"> </p>
                    <p>SURPASSEDrus (超えたルス Koetarusu), also known as Shitrus, Spicrus, Jobrus, Bitchrus, or Bills, is a surpassed, outdone jobber who hasn't been stronger than Goku since the Zamasu arc. This weak little bitch prides himself on being one of the strongest Gods of Destruction, despite the fact that all GoD's have been vastly eclipsed by the likes of Ultra Instinct Goku, Jiren, Broly, SSJB Gogeta and Moro.[1] He is canonically inferior in strength to Belmod, who himself is weaker than Jiren, and is always outdone by his rival Quitela, because mice always win against cats as per Toriyama's Will. His Ultra Instinct knowledge is likewise extremely limited and literally Muten Roshi tier, as he is only capable of a few fancy moves (before getting hit anyway), and even the half-baked, flawed, and incomplete UI -Sign- form was something above the level of what SHITrus is capable of.[2] In the CHADnon CHADnime Champa arc, this jobber was literally fucking scared of SSJBKKx10 Goku,[3] when in the ToP it is shown that SSJBKKx20 Goku cannot even damage a heavily suppressed Jiren at all.[4] Likewise, in the promotional tracefiction, SURPASSEDrus had to go tryhard simply to stomp CSSJB Bejita. Meanwhile, Jiren did NOT need to go serious to stomp the much stronger SSJBE Bejita.[5] SURPASSEDrus is later seen completely confused by the battle between MUI Goku and Jiren, relegating him to a Krillin-tier clueless bitch who needs Angels to explain to him what is going on.[6]</p>


<p>SURPASSEDrus shits himself at the sight of 1% of Jiren's ki. SURPASSEDrus is best known for hiding like a little bitch whenever threats stronger than him appear (like Broly and Moro), because he's afraid of getting exposed as a jobber. This is proven by the fact that Earth is his favorite place to hang out at because it has the most delicious food (which is canonically the only thing he cares about), yet he is completely willing to risk letting Earth be destroyed. Since Beerus is not bound by any rules forcing him to be "neutral" like the Angels, and is indeed allowed to follow his own whims selfishly, the only possible explanation for why he is willing so sit idly by and watch his favorite food planet be destroyed is simply: He can't actually do anything about these threats because they are stronger than GoDs. This is literally proven by the statements on advertising material and magazines that hype antagonists like Jiren and Broly up as being stronger than GoDs, which means the whole class of GoDs he belongs to are literally jobbers by the actual definition: They exist as a measuring stick to show off how much better the antagonist is. Thus, despite never losing a fight, SURPASSEDrus is still a fucking jobber. SURPASSEDrus nowadays spends his time praying that CHADku will somehow vanquish the enemies that threaten his favorite source of food, while pretending to not care. It is evident that SURPASSEDrus status as a SURPASSED jobber clearly bothers him, but he can't do anything about it so he just SEETHES silently.[7] In his fight with SSJG Goku, SURPASSEDrus has lost his hearing.</p>
