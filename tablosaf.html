                    <p>TablosAF, despite being a huge influence for the Dragon Ball community, he is very infamous for several comments and actions he made, such as criticizing several fan-manga authors for "stealing" his ideas and concepts for their versions of DB AF, stating that he is the true creator of AF. He had also harshly criticized Toyotarou, saying that his direction in Super is fine but lacks the "essence" of Dragon Ball (which, sometime later became a meme in the Spanish community as a mockery of him and western Dragon Ball fans obsessed with blood and gore).</p>
                  
                  <p>The form was originally designed by David Montiel Franco who stated that this art wasn't even supposed to be Goku or Super Saiyan 5, but his own OC, Tablos, in a transformation he called Spirit Killer. The image was first published in the Spanish magazine, Hobby Consolas. This form would go on to represent Super Saiyan 5 after it was included in many other fan manga, most famously by Youngjiji and another by Toyotarou, the latter of which was scouted to aid author Akira Toriyama in the new Dragon Ball Super manga due to his work with his doujinshi "Dragon Ball AF", based on the concept Franco originally put forth. Despite this, most fans agree that if Super Saiyan 5 existed, it would be the design Toyatarou chose for his version in AF, given Toyatarou is now the new lead author of Dragon Ball after the passing of Toriyama.</p>
